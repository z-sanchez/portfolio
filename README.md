## About <a name="whatitdoes"></a>
This is my portfolio site. It will serve as my hub for all my work and documentation of my journey in web development. As time goes on I hope to add new projects to it.

## How it works <a name="howit"></a>
The site was built mainly with html and bootstrap. Some javascript and css is sprinked in to make some finsihing touches.

## What I learned <a name="learned"></a>
- I haven't used bootstrap in a while, so this project helped to improve my knowledge of the framework.
